> ‘1980’ Generation Schools: New school designs sprang up in emerging housing estates. 12 different plans were introduced and each had a unique design identity. A common school design was a large sloping tiled roof and a steel space frame over a concourse.

## Introduction

The first time I noticed the 80s Generation Schools was when I was browsing Google Earth one day, and realised that the former campus of Lee Kuo Chuan Primary School looks exactly the same as Radin Mas Primary School.

Using Google Images (reverse image search), I found a lot of archival images of schools with identical designs. I was astonished that these schools were copy-and-pasted. I also observed that all of the campuses were built in the 1980s.

Since then, I’ve been looking around satellite maps searching for these clone schools. I’ve also used the image search results to find the schools on Google Earth. With the help of [MOE Heritage Centre’s website](https://moehc.moe.edu.sg/school-histories), I looked up the years of construction, demolition (for demolished schools), and campus upgrading. This article will present a list of the schools and some information about them.
