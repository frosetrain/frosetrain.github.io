## Introduction

LOLCODE is an esoteric programming language based on the meme language spoken by lolcats. It is quite a "normal" esolang, as it has many features usually seen in other programming languages like if/else, loops, functions, and stuff like that. It's not like brainfuck, which is just fully random and is explosive and weird.

## Syntax

### Boilerplate

You begin with the line

```
HAI 1.2
```

The number specifies the version of LOLCODE used.

At the end of the file, you must end with the line

```
KTHXBYE
```

Note that all keywords are case-sensitive, because lolcats always speak in ALL CAPS.
